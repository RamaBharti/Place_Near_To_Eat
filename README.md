# Places_Near_To_Eat
This contains the codes for finding restaurants near a user's location, using a 2-d tree algorithm.
We are given two files: one which contains the location of restaurants and other one which contains the user's location.
We get the output as number of restaurants within 100 units of latitude and 100 units of longitude from the user's location and we filter restaurants based on cost; the program only find the number of restaurants within the budget.
